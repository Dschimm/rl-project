The Machine Learning Reproducibility Checklist (v2.0, Apr.7 2020)

For all models andalgorithms presented, check if you include:
* ~~A clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model.~~
* ~~A clear explanation of any assumptions.~~
* ~~An analysis of the complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm.~~

For all datasetsused, check if you include:
* ~~The relevant statistics, such as number of examples.~~
* ~~The details of train / validation / test splits. ~~
* ~~An explanation of any data that were excluded, and all pre-processing step.~~
* ~~A link to a downloadable version of the dataset or simulation environment.~~

For all shared code related to this work, check if you include:
* ~~Specification of dependencies.~~
* ~~Training code.~~
* ~~Evaluation code.~~
* ~~(Pre-)trained model(s).~~
* ~~README file includes table of results accompanied by precise command to run to produce those results.~~

For all reported experimental results, check if you include:
* ~~The range of hyper-parameters considered, method to select the best hyper-parameter configuration, and specification of all hyper-parameters used to generate results.~~
* ~~The exact number of training and evaluation runs.~~
* ~~A clear definition of the specific measure or statistics used to report results.~~
* ~~A description of results with central tendency (e.g. mean) & variation (e.g. error bars).~~
* ~~The average runtime for each result, or estimated energy cost.~~
* ~~A description of the computing infrastructure used.~~~~
